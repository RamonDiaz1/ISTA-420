1.What is a data type? Why do we have data types?
* a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical 
operations can be applied to it without causing an error. A data type constrains the values that an expression, such as 
a variable or a function, might take.

2.What is a collation? Name four elements of a collation.
* Collation is a property of character data that encapsulates several aspects: language support, sort
order, case sensitivity, accent sensitivity, and more.  

3.How would you strip whitespace from a string? For example, suppose you had “ Dave ” but
wanted only “Dave”.
* Use the The RTRIM and LTRIM functions

4.Suppose you wanted to make a list of every college and university that was called an Institute from
the college table. Write the query.
*Select * From college where college_name like '%institure%';

5.How would you find the number of the index of the first space in a string? For example, the index of
the first space in “Barack Hussein Obama” would be 7.
*Use the instr() method

6.How would you select just the first name in a list of the presidents. Each record looks like the: ”George
Washington”, ”John Adams”, ”Thomas Jefferson”. First names can be an arbitrary length, from “Cal”
to “Benjamin.” (e.g., Cal College, Benjamin Harrison)
*use the SUBSTRING() method

7.What is the order of precedence for the logical operators?
* * NOT
* AND
* BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, OR

8.What is the order of precedence for the math operators?
* ( ) (Parentheses)
* *(Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulo)
* +(Positive), – (Negative), + (Addition), + (Concatenation), – (Subtraction)

9.What is the difference between a simple and a searched CASE expression?;
*You use the simple form to compare one value or scalar expression with a list of possible values and return
a value for the first match. A searched CASE returns the value in the THEN clause that is associated with
the first WHEN predicate that evaluates to TRUE.

10.How would you turn a list of names like this: “LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME”, to a list like this:
“FIRSTNAME LASTNAME”?
*select substring('LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME', instr('LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME', ' ')+1) || ' ' || substring('LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME', 1, instr('LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME', ', '));

11.How would you turn a list of names like this: “FIRSTNAME LASTNAME”, to a list like this: “LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME”?
*select substring('FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME', instr('FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME', ' ')+1) || ' ' || substring('FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME', 1, instr('FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME', ', '));
