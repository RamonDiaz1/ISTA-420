1. List the date/time types in T-SQL.
DATETIME 
SMALLDATETIME 
DATE 
TIME 
DATETIME2 
nanoseconds
##DATETIMEOFFSET

2.How do you express a date/time literal in T-SQL?
* You use a string literal

3.What is the setting DATEFORMAT used for?
* Determines how SQL Server interprets the literals you enter when they are converted from a character-string type to a date and time type.

4. Write a T-SQL snippet changing the date format to German. Read the documentation on how to do
this.
```
SET LANGUAGE german;
SELECT CAST('02/12/2016' AS DATE);
```

5.What is the difference between CAST(), CONVERT(), and PARSE()?
* Casting is when you take a variable of one type and change it to a different type. 
converting is when you take a value from one type and convert it to a different type
Parsing is taking a string and converting it to a different type by understanding its content.

6.What function returns the current date? This is very useful in a table that maintains a log of events,
such as user logins.
* You use CURRENTTIME

7.How do you add one day to the current date? Add one week? Add one month? Add one year?
* Use the DATEADD() function


8.Write a SQL snippet to return the number of years between your birth date and todayâ€™s date.
* SELECT DATEDIFF(day, '20210124', '19960924');

9.How do you check a string literal to see if it represents a valid date?
* You use the ISDATE function

10.What does EOMONTH() do? Give an example of why this might be very useful.
* The EOMONTH function accepts an input date and time value and returns the respective end-ofmonth date as a DATE typed value. 
SELECT orderid, orderdate, custid, empid
FROM Sales.Orders
WHERE orderdate = EOMONTH(orderdate);

11.Payments are due exactly 30 days from the date of the last function. Write a select query that calculates
the date of the next payment. Pretend we want to update a column in a database that contains the
date of the next payment. We will do this when we write UPDATE queries.
FROM PAYMENTS SELECT CAST'DATEADD'

12. Suppose your son or daughter wants to run a query every day that tells them the number of days until
their 16th birthday. Write a select query that does this.
USE DATEDIFF
