##TSQL Homework 03

1.In general, why would you even want to join two (or more) tables together? This is a good time to
think about the nature of relational algebra.
* It allow users reference to two tables.

2.Describe in your own words the output from an inner join.
* The inner join output matches two querys.

3.Describe in your own words the output from an outer join.
* rows from two tables are matched.

4.Describe in your own words the output from an cross join.
* the output shows a combination from two tables.

5.A convenient mnemonic for remembering the various joins is “Ohio.” Why is this true?


6.Give an example of a composite join.
* A composite join, is a join where you need to match multiple attributes from each side.
FROM dbo.Table1 AS T1
 INNER JOIN dbo.Table2 AS T2
 ON T1.col1 = T2.col1
 AND T1.col2 = T2.col2

7.What is the difference between the following two queries? The business problem is “How many orders
do we have from each customer?
* In the first query you are selecting all number orders, while in the second you are selecting the order id.
```
================first query===============
SELECT C.custid, COUNT(*) AS numorders
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
ON C.custid = O.custid
GROUP BY C.custid;
================second query===============
SELECT C.custid, COUNT(O.orderid) AS numorders
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
ON C.custid = O.custid
GROUP BY C.custid;
```
8.What might be one reason the following query does not return the column custID in this query?
* you are selecting customerid from another table.
```
SELECT C.custid, C.companyname, O.orderid, O.orderdate
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
ON C.custid = O.custid
WHERE O.orderdate >= ’20160101’;
```
